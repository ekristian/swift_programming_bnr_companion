# Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide  
## The Companion  

The purpose of this repository is to provide the coded examples found in the book along with the challenges and some additional commentary obtained while reading the book.  

I chose to implement all of the examples using XCode projects verus the Swift Playgrounds suggested in the text. Difficulties with the stability of the playgrounds in XCode lead me to the decision to use command-line projects.
